# koboaccountant
Koboaccountant is a platform established to provide Professional Accounting Services (PAS) to Business Startups, Small and Medium scale enterprises (and Individuals) who prior to now werenâ€™t able to access this services (PAS) largely due to the affordability (cost of hiring an Accountant or a Financial Consultant). 
We therefore structured our value added services with the aim of ensuring startups and SMEs have proper financial records, access to Professional advice, and as a consequence, grow into the business that will shape Africa and indeed the world.
